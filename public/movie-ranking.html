<h1>The Best TV Shows According to Samuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 TV shows of all-time</h2>

<br />

<h3>The Expanse</h3>
<p>
    This show was my first introduction to hard sci-fi (science-fiction that tries its best to stay as close as possible to rigorous scientific fact). Because of it, every now and then, I feel sad that I was not born 200 years in the future.

<h3>Outlander</h3>
<p>
    I always enjoyed time travel stories, and the most important question that every story of this genre must address is the impact of any action taken in a time that is not the character's own will have. In Back to the Future, actions taken in the past affect the future that you return to. The Peripheral opted for the alternate timelines theory. But, this show introduced me to the loop theory which stipulates that the future or present as known has already accounted for the inadequate presence and actions of a time traveler in the past. Love it!

<h3>Avatar The Last Airbender</h3>
<p>
    I have rewatched this TV show 5 times. That does not include my first watch of the live action show which only has one season so far. This should tell you how much I love it.
